    "\n",
    "In the sense of machine learning models, what is underfitting? What is the most common reason for underfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Underfitting is a scenario in data science where a data model is unable to capture the relationship between the input and output variables accurately, generating a high error rate on both the training set and unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does it mean to overfit? When is it going to happen\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting happens when a model learns the detail and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data. This means that the noise or random fluctuations in the training data is picked up and learned as concepts by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the sense of model fitting, explain the bias-variance trade-off\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias is known as the difference between the prediction of the values by the ML model and the correct value. Being high in biasing gives a large error in training as well as testing data. By high bias, the data predicted is in a straight line format, thus not fitting accurately in the data in the data set."

    "The silhouette width is also an estimate of the average distance between clusters. Its value is comprised between 1 and -1 with a value of 1 indicating a very good cluster.\n",
    "Boosting vs. Bagging:\n",
    "Bagging is a way to decrease the variance in the prediction by generating additional data for training from dataset using combinations with repetitions to produce multi-sets of the original data.\n",
    "Boosting is an iterative technique which adjusts the weight of an observation based on the last classification.\n",
    "The eager learner vs. the lazy learner:\n",
    "A lazy learner delays abstracting from the data until it is asked to make a prediction.\n",
    "while an eager learner abstracts away from the data during training and uses this abstraction to make predictions rather than directly compare queries with instances in the dataset."
