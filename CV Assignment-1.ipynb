    "Answer->Edge Detection is when we use matrix math to calculate areas of different intensities of an image. Areas where there are extreme differences in the intensities of the pixel usually indicate an edge of an object. After finding all of the large differences in intensities in a picture, we have discovered all of the edges in the picture. Sobel Edge detection is a widely used algorithm of edge detection in image processing. Along with Canny and Prewitt, Sobel is one of the most popular edge detection algorithms used in today's technology."

They're also used in machine learning for 'feature extraction', a technique for determining the most important portions of an image. In this context the process is referred to more generally as \"convolution\""

For example, if the padding in a CNN is set to zero, then every pixel value that is added will be of value zero. If, however, the zero padding is set to one, there will be a one pixel border added to the image with a pixel value of zero."

Stride is a parameter of the neural network's filter that modifies the amount of movement over the image or video. For example, if a neural network's stride is set to 1, the filter will move one pixel, or unit, at a time. The size of the filter affects the encoded output volume, so stride is often set to a whole integer, rather than a fraction or decimal."
